## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learned about making use of opacity on hover, for creating the active states. 
I started working on this project a while back and got to it to check how it looks, turns out I went a little overboard with giving classes to elements, it confused me a bit when trying to style.
Working on the project was fun, I enjoyed every challenge and learnt not repeat mistakes.

```html
<div class="btn-cta">Proceed to Payment</div>
```
```css
.card .btn-cta:hover{
    opacity: 0.7;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on working more with css grid and add functionaliyies with javascript

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/ - This helped me generally
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/ - I could go back to check articles and solutions I had earlier read and practced. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning responsive web design.
